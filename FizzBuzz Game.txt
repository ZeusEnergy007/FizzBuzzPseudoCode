Let us play a game!
It's a counting game named "Fizz Buzz."  Here's how to play...

I'll give you a number and you say it out loud.  Easy. Almost.

Here are the rules.

* If the number I give you is divisible by 3, you'll say "Fizz" instead of the number.  
* If the number is divisible by 5, you'll say "Buzz."  
* If it's divisible by 3 and 5, you'll say "Fizz Buzz." 
* Otherwise, say the number. 

Your first number will be 1 and we'll stop when we reach 16.

Again, your first number is 1.  

Do these steps:
1. Is your number divisible by 3 and 5?
	If Yes, say "Fizz Buzz!", then go to Step 5.
	If No, go to Step 2.

2. Is your number divisible by 5?
	If Yes, say "Buzz!", then go to Step 5.
	If No, go to Step 3.

3. Is your number divisible by 3?
	If Yes, say "Fizz!", then go to Step 5.
	If No, go to Step 4.

4. If your number did not qualify for any of the above steps,
	just say your number, then go to Step 5.

5. Add 1 to your number.
	Go to step 6.

6. Is your new number less than 16?
	If Yes, go back to Step 1.
	If No, go to Step 7.

7. is your new number 16?
	If Yes, say "16!"
	If No, something has gone horribly wrong in the universe.  Run!

 
Thank you for playing Fizz Buzz!
